## Implementation

### Dashboard & Metrics
Our team of four developed multiple pages, starting with the landing page and the login/signup page. The main highlight is the dashboard page, which showcases crucial social media metrics, including:

- Total likes
- Total retweets
- Total comments
- Total views

All this data was web-scraped from real Twitter statistics 

### Campaign List & Details
On the dashboard, we included a campaign list displayed in a table format. The table included essential details such as target audience and team members. Clicking on a campaign revealed a pop-up box containing comprehensive campaign insights, including:

- Campaign type
- Budget
- Goals
- Metrics
- Post images of the campaign

### Reports & Chatbot
We also developed a report page, which stores detailed reports of all campaigns and marketing strategies. Users can download reports directly from our platform for further analysis. Additionally, we integrated an AI-powered chatbot to assist users with queries anytime.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend & Databases
- **Backend**: Built using FastAPI for seamless connection with the database and handling model requests.

- **Databases**:
  - **MongoDB** - Stores textual campaign data in JSON format.
  - **Cloudinary** - Stores images, with links referenced in MongoDB.

### AI & Model Integrations
We incorporated multiple AI models to enhance the platformâ€™s capabilities:

- **GROQ** - Generates campaign taglines, slogans, captions, and themes.
- **Pollination AI** - Generates images for campaigns.
- **ElevenLabs Turbo v2** - Generates voice-overs for videos.
